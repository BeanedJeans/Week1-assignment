            Welcome to Jean's Assignment Journal!
        </h1>
        <p>
            Welcome to the page where I make random assignment rants and cry about games. 
            <br>I created this to rant about nonsense and show you just how insane I take things.<br> 
            You'll find English assignment rants which I love, math assignments I not-so-love, intro to programming assignments I don't mind, and then game programming classes that make me want to cry.
